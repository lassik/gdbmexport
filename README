gdbmexport-unofficial 1.14.1
============================

GNU dbm made changes to its database file format from version 1.8 to
1.9 and dropped backward compatibility. For a short time, the gdbm
package shipped with a gdbmexport tool to convert databases from the
old format into a dump file format that new versions of gdbm can load.

gdbmexport was always difficult to build: it was an optional feature
disabled by default in the configure script, and depended on a
_separate_ build of an old version of libgdbm being installed. What's
worse, the tool was removed altogether starting with version 1.15.

Performing the archaic autotools incantations required to reanimate
this mess on current machines seems almost impossible. It turned out
to be far easier to isolate the right source files by hand from the
1.8.3 and 1.14.1 source releases.

Here are the resuts so you don't have to jump through the same
hoops. Use at your own risk. Compiling is just:

    cc -Wall -o gdbmexport *.c
